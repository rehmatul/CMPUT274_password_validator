#    Weekly Assignment#1: Password Validator
# --------------------------------------------------

   Files included:
1) validator.py
2) README

   Notes: 

The file validator.py contains two functions "generate" and "vaidate". 

*  The validate function takes in a string argument and determines if the password entered is "Invalid", "Insecure" or "Secure". The function returns the result as a string which is then outputted when the function is called in the terminal. 
It makes use of the list datatype to store all the allowed digits, special characters and forbidden characters. The code traverses the string input and checks one character at a time to determine the nature of the password.

*  The generate function takes an integer(n) argument and generates a "secure" password of that length(n). To improve efficiency, the password generator uses an algorithm which produces a secure password in the first place such that it doesnt need to use the validate function. Since passwords shorter than 8 characters are deemed invalid, the generator gives an error statement if n is less than 8. 

  Assumptions:
* The program assumes that the data entered as an argument for the validate function is a string. 

  Running Instructions:

* Open a terminal window and run python3
* Import the validator file in the terminal and use the "validator.validate(password)" or     "validator.generate(n)" command in the terminal to see the functions work.
